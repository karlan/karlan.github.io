My name is Jianwei Lyu and I'm an astronomy graduate at Steward Observatory.
This site records many things I like -- astronomy, star-gazing, painting,
running, books, movies, traveling, and so forth. I'm also trying to make plain
introduction of my own research.

You can say hello to me on [Douban][douban], [Weibo][weibo], or (possibly)
[Twitter][twitter]. My academic home page is still in preparation.
