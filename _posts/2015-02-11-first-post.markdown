There are a bunch of PLANCK papers come out since last week
([here][planck_publication]). Sean Carroll has [a nice post][Sean_post]. We had
a discussion this morning on paper XIII cosmological parameters. My impression
is that the LCDM model works perfectly. Yes, we had downsized the errors, but
everything looks so great that we can barely do any thing big. Though there is
some tension (for example, cluster counts are discrepant with the Planck
results, leading different values for \\( \sigma _8 \\) ).

I was enlightened by [a paper][brant_paper]. I had never seriously thought
about the relation between cosmic reionization and the star formation
information of z~6-8 quasars.
