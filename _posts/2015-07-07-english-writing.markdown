As an English learner for over 12 years, I still make huge amounts of mistakes. What a shame!

## general guidelines

* In astronomy, there are only challenges, not problems

* don't write papers in a talkative manner

* avoid saying sth. obvious

* try to think about a good story line, not to list a number of random stuffs

* Do not assume the readers would read tha appendix. Summarize key points in the main part.

* pay attentaion to what is stressed
   
     Indeed, observations have revealed many different properties of high-z galaxies ...
     Indeed, observations have revealed the properties of high-z galaxies that differ from

## style

* avoid using the same word mutiple times but with different meanings

* In American and Canadian English, fit is often uninflected in the the past tense and as a past participle. Outside North America, writers typically favor fitted for these uses, check http://grammarist.com/usage/fit-fitted/


* there is/are 大部分情况下没有用

* .... to be XXX 不如 we XXX 了什么

* never write (or even speak) “we can see that ...." also avoid saying "we XX that"

* references are discouraged in abstracts

* "It is" - abbreviations like "It's" are generally not used in formal writing.

* "we are not sure if ..." (that's because you are stupid!) ---> "it is not clear if ..."

* "for dust obscured SF, we could .... " ---> "The dust-obscured SF can be determined from  ..."

*  .... is not better than ... that much in ...
 ---> .... is not much better than ... in

* Herschel Space Observatory should be should be italicized.  Acronyms are not italicized though, so WISE shouldn’t be


* avoid *as we will ...*

* saying "the first XXX", "the only XXX" can be naive in some cases

* avoid unnecessary adv., e.g., *may not directly apply at high-z*
  cut unnecessary adj.

* I think "various" is a stupid word, if you could avoid use it.

* in text, Figure 8 can not come before Figure 7

* *before that*, *after that* , *It is important to keep in mind that* are also some stupid phrases

* if you have *for example*, *such as*, *etc* should not appear in the end

* *observed* is not necessary before words like *spectrum*, *SED*, *photometry*

* the first word after the colon should not be capitalized

*  $z=1\sim4$  --> $z\sim 1-4$

* "is fitted to" in place of "fitting is applied on"

* As show in the paper, --> We show that ...

## spelling/words

* *constraints* , not constrains

* deviation / derivation

* combining, not combing
    
* consistence / consistency

* nowdays --> nowadays

* analysis/analyze

* nuclei/nucleus/nuclear

* continuum/continua

* bolemetric --> bolometric

* chi-square, not chi-squares

* tend is a verb.

* derviation --> derivation

* rougly --> roughly

* a lot of variation, not a lot of variance

* happened --> happening

* *relatively hot*, not *relative hot*
  *optically thin*, not *optical thin*


* with SEDs deviating XX, not with SEDs deviated XX

## prep.

* constraints on, not constraints of ...

* upper limits of 3 sigma --> upper limits at 3 sigma

* such warm excess *as* at high-z

* this corresponds *to* ..

* not "in a theoretical perspective", but "from a theoretical perspective"

* there should no star formation main sequence as *is* the case

* an offset from 1:1 *on* the correlation between ... and ....

* introduce uncertainties into (not of) the result 

* the same trend as ..., not the same trend of ...

* be representative *to* (not *of*) 

* correct *for* the host galaxy emission

* we comment *on* XXX

* the fitting results *for* each SED 

* in the same fashion *as* ... , not in the same fashion *of* ...


* to get any information *regarding* (rather than *of*) host galaxies

* heating processes for (rather than of) the IR emission 

* *judging by XX*, not *judging on XX*

* the SED *at* 10-1000 micron

* Not *in the first order*, but *to first order*

* Not *in the order of XX*, but *on the order of XX*

* put upper-limits *on* (rather than *of*)

## tex

* $L_{\rm FIR}$

* mean/average $\langle L_{\rm FIR} \rangle$


* if you got equation, put all parts into the $$


## misc

* words that are pronounced beginning with a vowel sound take ‘an’ instead of ‘a’ even though they start with a consonant. “an hour”, “an X-ray”, “an SED” vs “a unique snowflake”, “a university” , etc.
  "an IFU"

* missing *the*  介词后面的单数名词都一般该加（？）
   the MSA

* after comma, use *which* may be a good idea

* based on *the* above arguments

* a XXX galaxy *that* shares typical features of high-z galaxies (*that* is prefered than *which*)

*  XX and XX can give physically-motivated fits that (not which) sucessfully reproduce ...

* the high-z galaxies that can (rather than *which could*) be ...

* a method *that* works for ...



* 单数/复数一致

* at different times/redshifts,
  at any wavelengths (not *wavelengthes*)

* we use *MCMC methods* to ....

* *two orders of magnitude*, not *two orders of magnitudes* ! change order, not magnitude

* large *amounts* of resources

* *there is ample observational evidence*, not *there are ample observational evidences*



* A, B, C, and D

* e.g., don't forget the comma

* see, e.g., XXX

* there is a space before the left bracket (



*  standard deviation and standard error
