* avoid unnecessary adv., e.g., *may not directly apply at high-z*
  cut unnecessary adj.

* in text, Figure 8 can not come before Figure 7

* *before that*, *after that* , *It is important to keep in mind that* are also some stupid phrases

* In astronomy, there are only challenges, not problems

* bolemetric --> bolometric

* *judging by XX*, not *judging on XX*

* Do not assume the readers would read tha appendix. Summarize key points in the main part.
